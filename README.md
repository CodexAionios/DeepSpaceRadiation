# Deep Space Radiation Initiative

## Mission
To develop a comprehensive, evidence‑based understanding of radiation effects on human biology beyond Earth's magnetosphere, with the goal of ensuring safe deep space exploration.

## The Challenge
Current space radiation risk models rely heavily on data collected within Earth's protective magnetosphere. These models fail to account for the unique radiation environment beyond L2, where astronauts face unfiltered galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events. The complex biological effects of this environment cannot be accurately extrapolated from LEO experiences.

## Our Approach
This project integrates:
1. **Real‑world deep space measurements** (including JWST radiation event data)
2. **Advanced laboratory simulations** of the deep space radiation environment
3. **Multimodal biological testing** across cellular, tissue, and systemic levels
4. **Comprehensive engineering safety assessments** for spacecraft design

## Why This Matters
Current Mars mission architectures underestimate the combined challenges of:
- Radiation exposure beyond Earth's magnetosphere
- Physiological deconditioning from prolonged microgravity
- Engineering safety compromises driven by cost optimization

Without addressing these challenges, we risk mission failure and astronaut safety.

## Project Status
This initiative is in its formation stage. We are currently:
- Building our collaborative framework
- Establishing research priorities
- Developing technical approaches for radiation environment simulation
